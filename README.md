# My Very First Webpage 
Welcome to my very first website. 

I built this as part of my learning whilst doing code institutes level 5. 

You can see the full website [Here](https://janebmckenna.github.io/test-site/index.html) 

## Project Description 
---
Initially, i am using this site to get familiar with IDE and development tools. I am a big fan of penguins hence the photo choice. I want to use this site to learn how to write and manage code. 

## Technology 
---
This project was written in html and CSS. I used code anywhere and hosted it on Github pages.
